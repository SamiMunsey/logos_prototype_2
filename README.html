The program is designed for handling the data of and the relationships between 2
groups of real-world entities:<br>

    1) borrowers<br>
    2) resources<br>
<br>
Borrowers <br>
<br>
2 tables handle borrower information:

    1) borrower - for data that should be relevant to all borrowers<br>
    2) borrower_info - for data that may not pertain to every borrower<br>

Borrowers may be placed into groups, which can be manipulated en masse. A third 
table stores group information:<br>
    3) group<br>
and a fourth stores the relationships between borrowers and groups (what borrowers
are a member of what group):<br>
    4) borrower_group<br>
<br>
Resources <br>
<br>
3 tables handle resource information: <br>
    1) resource - for resource-related data that should be relevant to all resources <br>
    2) resource_info - for resource-related data that may not pertain to every resource <br>
    3) library_info - for information that describes the resource's relationship with <br>
    the library - e.g. where it is located in the library <br>
<br>
A forth table contains the subject heading list (controlled thesaurus), which is to be 
searched for subject headings that relate to a resource: <br>
    4) subject_heading <br>
and another table stores the relationship between subject headings and resources:<br>
    5) <br>
